Title
Exploring Spotify Data Using R

Abstract
This project delves into analyzing Spotify streaming history to uncover insights into personal music listening habits and preferences. By employing R programming and a suite of libraries including jsonlite, lubridate, gghighlight, spotifyr, tidyverse, knitr, ggplot2, and plotly, raw JSON streaming data is transformed into meaningful visual representations. The analysis spans various dimensions such as weekly and hourly playback activity, artist-specific trends, and the emotional impact of favorite artists. This comprehensive approach provides a nuanced understanding of individual music consumption patterns, highlighting the value of data analytics and visualization in personalizing user experiences.

Problem Statement
In the digital era, music streaming services generate vast amounts of data from user interactions. However, this data often remains underutilized. The project aims to address this gap by systematically analyzing Spotify streaming history to extract valuable insights into listening habits and preferences. The challenge lies in converting raw, unstructured data into structured, actionable information that can enhance the understanding of user behavior and preferences.

Introduction
Music streaming platforms like Spotify have revolutionized music consumption by providing access to millions of songs. This project seeks to analyze Spotify's streaming history data to gain insights into users' listening habits. Utilizing the R programming language and various data manipulation and visualization libraries, the project transforms raw streaming data into meaningful insights. The goal is to uncover patterns and trends in music consumption, offering a deeper understanding of user preferences and behaviors.

Methodology
The project follows a systematic methodology comprising data collection, processing, and analysis. Data is collected from Spotify's streaming history JSON files and the Spotify API. Using jsonlite for JSON data parsing and spotifyr for API access, the raw data is transformed into a structured format with tidyverse and lubridate. The analysis involves visualizing playback activity by week and hour, identifying most listened-to artists, and exploring emotional impacts using ggplot2 and gghighlight. Interactive visualizations are created with plotly to enhance user engagement and exploration.

Scope
The scope of this project includes the comprehensive analysis of Spotify streaming data to uncover various dimensions of music listening behavior. It covers weekly and hourly playback trends, artist-specific listening patterns, and emotional impacts based on energy and valence attributes. The project also aims to establish connections with the Spotify API to enrich the dataset with additional features, providing a thorough analysis of tracks and artists. This approach ensures a detailed understanding of personal music consumption patterns.

Results
The project successfully demonstrates the power of data analytics and visualization in extracting meaningful insights from Spotify streaming history. The analysis reveals significant trends in weekly and hourly playback activity, artist-specific listening habits, and the most frequently listened-to musicians. Additionally, the emotional impact of music is visualized, providing insights into the emotional influence of favorite artists. The interactive visualizations created with plotly allow users to dynamically explore their listening habits, offering a rich and engaging data exploration experience.
